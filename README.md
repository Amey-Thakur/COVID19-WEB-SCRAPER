<!-- OVERVIEW -->
## Overview

The **COVID19-WEB-SCRAPER** is a Python-based utility developed to provide real-time insights into the COVID-19 situation in India. It programmatically extracts live data from the **[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW)](https://www.mohfw.gov.in)** website and processes it into actionable visualizations.

Developed as a mini-project for the **Open Source Tech Lab**, this tool demonstrates the practical application of web scraping (BeautifulSoup), data manipulation (Pandas), and complex statistical visualization (Matplotlib & Seaborn).

<!-- FEATURES -->
## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Live Scraping** | Real-time data extraction from official MOHFW sources |
| **Tabular Reports** | Clean, formatted console representation using `PrettyTable` |
| **Data Processing** | Automated parsing and integer conversion via `Pandas` |
| **Bar Plots** | Comparative analysis of confirmed cases across different States/UTs |
| **Donut Charts** | Proportional distribution of Nationwide Confirmed, Recovered, and Deceased cases |

### Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Libraries**: BeautifulSoup4, Requests, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, PrettyTable
- **Environment**: Local Machine / Google Colab / Kaggle

<!-- USAGE -->
## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x**: Ensure the core interpreter is installed on your local environment.
- **Terminal**: Access to a Bash shell or command prompt for manual execution.
- **Dependencies**: Install the required analytical libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib requests beautifulsoup4 prettytable
```

### Installation & Deployment

1. **Clone the Collection**  
   Retrieve the localized repository using the following Git command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amey-Thakur/COVID19-WEB-SCRAPER.git
   cd COVID19-WEB-SCRAPER
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**  
   Navigate to the source directory and verify that all dependencies are resolved.

3. **Execution**
